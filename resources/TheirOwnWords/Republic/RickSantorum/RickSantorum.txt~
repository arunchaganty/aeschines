I am the son of an Italian immigrant. My father’s journey to America rescued him from a childhood as a “brown shirt” and likely some cog in Mussolini’s war machine . But it wasn’t as easy as simply boarding a ship and coming to America for my dad. My Italian -­‐ speaking grandfather was able to come to America in order to flee this new fascist regime in 1923 in spite of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 that limited Italian immigrants to just a few thousand Italians per year. Turns out that his home town in Italy was part of Austria before World War I, so my grandfather was considered an Austrian. He was able to come but wasn’t unable to bring his Italian children with him . In 1930 , he became a citizen after working most of that time in the coal mines of southwestern Pennsylvania. He was then able to unite with his family in America. When my father told me about our family’s journey to America, I asked him the natural question: “Did you resent America for keeping you away from your father and in a fascist country for the first seven years of your life?” He said “no, America was worth the wait.” He was right. America was worth the wait , because we have been a country that puts the law above the people making and executing that law. The greatest protection each of us has is that no one, NO ONE, in America is above the law, including presidents, judges and, yes, immigrants. The laws that kept my father and grandfather apart were passed because our nation needed to balance labor markets, national security interests , or any number of legitimate reasons for limiting an inflow of new immigrants . But the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 targeted Italians and Jews in part because of concerns about assimilation and in part because of rank prejudice While I won’t demand the government of Mexico to build the wall , I want US workers to do that, I will make it clear to the Mexican government they must stop facilitating this lawlessness on the border and cooperate with our efforts. I will do all I can to change Mexico’s behavior to the benefit of both countries. However, if they fail to cooperate I am prepared to stop authorizing border crossing cards as a first step in getting their cooperation. Visa overstays is one of the largest – if not the largest – factor contributing to our illegal immigrant population . The defacto policy of this administration is to track visa entries, but not exits. I will do what no previous Administration has. I will enforce the law by implementing a biometric tracking system for every immigrant who enters America so we can track who is here and who has overstayed their visa. Anyone apprehended who has overstayed their visa should be subject to fines and then subsequently removed. I will end the practice of sanctuary cities by withholding federal funds from any city that refuses to cooperate with federal authorities. I support Kate’s Law and with it ending the policy that resulted in 30,000 criminal illegal immigrants being released from prison last year because their native country won’t accept them. I will exercise my authority to deny visas to any foreign countries that will not take responsibility for their citizens . The federal government has to end policies that have encouraged millions to break the law. I will put an end to president Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesty which is largely responsible for the latest border surge . I will push for congressional action to require all businesses use e -­‐ verify for all employees to assure those who play by the rules are rewarded and employers who hire illegal immigrants are held accountable . I will propose we join every other developed country in the world save one, and put an end to automatic citizenship for children born here to illegal immigrants. This enforcement of , by in large , existing law will dramatically reduce the number of illegal immigrants competing against legal workers for jobs in America . However,reducing the number of illegal immigrants will not be sufficient to help struggling American workers. I am proposing two changes to the legal immigration system that will reduce the supply of lower skilled adults holding wages down in America. Like Jeb Bush I am proposing eliminating both the visa lottery and chain migration. Unlike Jeb I will not be increasing other categories. These changes will result in a 25% reduction in legal immigration. This is in stark contrast with every Repu blican presidential candidate except Trump who says he also wants to return to historical averages . Some like Ted Cruz have actually proposed doubling legal immigration. I believe immigration can be a ver y good thing. But as with anything, there can also be too much of a good thing. When our labor markets cannot manage the influx we are receiving, then it is time to recalibrate. This is not anti -­‐ immigrant , this is pro -­‐ worker , especially those who are most affected by waves of new workers – recent immigrants, minorities and younger workers. Even skilled workers have been hurt by our current system. This year Disney laid off Americans and replaced them with cheap foreign labor and Southern California E dison had the nerve to have its American workers train their foreign replacements under the H1B visa program. There is an oversupply of American workers who can fill entry level tech jobs coming out of our education system. They should be given the oppor tunity to get work in their chosen field, grow in experience and rise. I propose overhauling the H1 -­‐ B visa program so that only the highest skilled workers who can stimulate the economy, and create more jobs here at home are eligible . Again this is in stark contrast with other Republicans particularly Ted Cruz who seeks to increase H1Bs five -­‐ fold . But in the same vein, there is a sector of our economy that has needs that are not currently being met by US workers – namely agriculture. Of the over 400 job classifications at the Department of Commerce , only a handful are the majority of workers in that category immigrant workers. Most are in agriculture. For illegal immigrant workers who are in these classifications, I will provide the opportunity for their empl oyers to pay an annual fee to permit these workers to continue to work as temporary guest workers. As my father said, America is worth the wait and it is worth doing it right. This means we need an immigration policy that rewards those who do it right, an immigration policy that fits our economic needs, and an immigration policy that puts the American worker first. I was asked in the first presidential debate how I would explain the enforcement of our immigration laws to the child of an illegal immigrant. I said our compassion as a government is found in our laws because we treat everyone equally under those laws. This must be true for our immigration laws. Having an immigration system that turns its back on American citizens and legal immigrants so that more immigrants can come to our shores at a time when there are not enough good paying jobs to meet their needs is not compassionate. What is compassionate is an immigration system that not only says we want you in America, but says we can give you the opportunity to rise and reach the American dream each and every immigrant strives to achieve. That will be my policy as President. 

I once asked my father whether he resented being separated from his dad for the first seven years of his life, while he waited to legally immigrate to America. My dad said absolutely not. “America was worth the wait.” A common refrain I hear is that immigrants, like my father and grandfather, have a great work ethic or that it would be cruel to separate families. And as a Catholic, I am taught the virtues of love, charity, and compassion. But America’s immigration policy must first be about compassion for hard-working Americans. For the past decade-plus, wages for the 74 percent of Americans who don’t have college degrees have been stagnant, and median income has fallen, in part because of a combination of millions of illegal immigrants and new legal immigrants coming to this country per year. The impact of this economic stagnation has struck native-born African Americans and Hispanics harder than whites. Since 2000, the employment rate for native-born African Americans has worsened by 9.2 percent and Hispanics by 7.7 percent, while employment for whites has worsened by 6.1 percent. Granting amnesty only exacerbates this problem. To me, the solution is clear. First, we must secure the border and end the acute border surge. The southwestern border is out of control. The way to bring it under control is more and better fencing and more smartly-deployed manpower. To be effective, a fence needs to be similar to the border fencing that Israel uses – high with barbed wire, a screening fence, and a patrol road along it. The complementary way to achieve operational control of the border is to strengthen the Border Patrol: complete surveillance systems; more manpower, especially in the short-run; and reformed Border Patrol operations. Meanwhile, we have acute border surges because the Obama Administration has let unaccompanied minors from countries other than Mexico, and asylum-seekers, be moved away from the border and thus almost never deported. This non-enforcement of the law has encouraged more such border crossings. The way to end these crossings is to never let unaccompanied minors or asylum-seekers move from the border, to increase the resources needed to judge their cases, and to deport most of them. Second, all entries and exits should be tracked. Stopping illegal immigrants from crossing the border is just one part of curbing illegal immigration. Very roughly 40 percent of illegal immigrants first enter legally but then overstay their visas (the exact number is unknown). The government’s existing entry-exit tracking system, US-VISIT, does not track 100 percent of entries and tracks few exits. It should be completed and track all of them. The burden of eliminating the problems caused by illegal immigration does not only lie at the feet of border enforcement, it is also the responsibility of businesses not to tempt illegal immigrants into our country. This is why I believe the E-Verify system must be made mandatory, apply to existing employees as well as new hires, inform employers if there is no match between the Social Security Number and other information submitted, and inform employees if there is possible identity fraud from excessive multiple use. Other enticements to illegal immigration, such as birthright citizenship, should be ended. Only children born on American soil where at least one parent is a citizen or resident aliens is automatically a U.S. citizen. Of developed countries other than the United States, only Canada has birthright citizenship. And existing laws should simply be enforced. There should be a sufficient number of immigration judges and a sufficient number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to do so, as well as expedited procedures for removing illegal immigrants who come into the custody of law enforcement. Third, we should reduce legal immigration from its current level of 1,050,000 immigrants a year to about 750,000 annually. Our legal immigration system is broken, and we are allowing record-high numbers of legal immigrants to come to America. This has an impact on our economy and American workers who are competing with a million new immigrants each year for jobs. To accomplish this, we must first start with eliminating chain migration (the immigration of adult relatives) and the diversity visa lottery (a random global give-away of American citizenship). These policies are antiquated, unfair, out of step with the policies of other developed countries, and not based on the needs of our nation. In the one area of our economy where we have a need for immigrants, agricultural, we must establish a workable agricultural guest worker program. This program should be managed by the Department of Agriculture to meet the needs of our farmers. Fourth, we should not grant worker permits to illegal immigrants, i.e. amnesty, except to agricultural workers as described above. And we should allow the Obama amnesties (3-year temporary work permits) to lapse naturally by not renewing them. I have compassion, respect and admiration for people around the world who want to be Americans. It’s our job to make sure America will always be a place for those immigrants we accept will be able to aspire to freedom and opportunity like my father. We do that by keeping America safe, preserving her values and creating a strong economy for everyone. An immigration policy that prioritizes American’s needs, workers, and families is where that starts.

Rand Paul insists he’s not an “isolationist.” Writing this week in TIME, he says, “I look at the world, and consider war, realistically and constitutionally.” But in reality, the Kentucky senator has advanced a brand of neo-isolationism and appeasement that is as short-sighted as it mistaken. Despite his recent, and frantic efforts to recast himself as not completely ridiculous on national security issues, the truth is his record often puts him in league with Barack Obama—or even to the president’s left. Anyone who truly cares about American liberty at home must not ignore real enemies and rising threats abroad. Rather, we must confront such challenges wisely and decisively to protect American lives, our economy and our allies. He may be changing his tune now, but he can’t hide from his record. Senator Paul has long been wrong and far out of the mainstream on three key matters – Iran, the Islamic State and Israel. Let’s look at each in turn. Iran: Senator Paul now says “all options are on the table” when it comes to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. But few believe he is serious. In a radio interview in 2007, while helping his father, isolationist Rep. Ron Paul, run for president, Rand actually denied that Iran is a threat to the United States or Israel. He did so despite the fact that the U.S. government designated Iran a “state sponsor of terrorism” as far back as 1984. “Even our own intelligence community consensus opinion now is that they [Iran] are not a threat,” Rand said. “Like my dad says, [the Iranians] don’t have an Air Force, they don’t have a Navy. You know, it’s ridiculous to think they’re a threat to our national security…. It’s not even that viable to say they’re a national threat to Israel.” In September 2012, the U.S. Senate voted 90 to 1 in support of Joint Resolution 41 to advance a firm American policy “to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability,” a policy that “urges continued and increasing economic and diplomatic pressure on …I ran,” and one that “warns that time is limited to prevent … Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.” The authors specifically noted: “nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war.” The focus was exclusively on urging the Obama administration to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran. The resolution was even non-binding. Nevertheless, this was all too much for Senator Paul, who chose to be the only member of the U.S. Senate to vote against it. In February 2013, Sen. Paul delivered a disturbing speech at the Heritage Foundation in which he urged leaders in Washington to seriously consider a policy of “containing” a nuclear-armed Iran, rather than focusing like a laser on preventing the Islamic Republic from building or acquiring nuclear warheads. “Containment,” Paul said, “should be discussed as an option.” This, however, put him to the left of President Obama, who has said, “Iran’s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment. I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” In January 2014, Senator Paul sided with President Obama in opposing the passage of new economic sanctions on Iran, further evidence he would rather appease the mullahs in Tehran than ratchet up pressure on them to give up their illegal and dangerous nuclear program. “I think while they [the Iranians] are negotiating – and if we can see they’re negotiating in good faith – I don’t think it’s a good idea to pass sanctions,” Paul told CNN. The Islamic State: Earlier this summer, Paul questioned in the Wall Street Journal whether there was any good reason for the U.S. military to stop or even slow down the Islamic State’s jihadist offensive in Iraq. He did so despite the fact that ISIL, as it is commonly known, has been slaughtering Muslims and Christians across the region. Yet he saw no serious threat to the American people from ISIL and could not bring himself to support the use of U.S. airpower to help our Arab and Kurdish allies defeat ISIL and prevent the establishment of a radical Islamic caliphate. What’s more, he continued to argue that it is in part the GOP’s fault that Iraq is fast becoming the epicenter of terrorism.

It is painful beyond words to behold the bloodthirsty brutality of the jihadists in the Middle East right now. But perhaps even more disturbing is the sight of an American president unable or unwilling to accurately assess the magnitude of the threat to America and our allies, and taking hesitant, awkward, vacillating half-measures in response. The forces of radical Islam are on the move. In Syria, nearly 200,000 people are dead. Millions are on the run. In Iraq, the jihadists are slaughtering Muslims, Christians, and other minorities. In Gaza, the radicals have fired more than 3,800 rockets aimed at massacring Israeli civilians. The jihadists may use different names (the Islamic State, Hamas, Islamic Jihad) and different tactics (rockets, tunnels, beheadings), but their goals are the same. Obliterate Israel. Topple our Arab allies. Establish an Islamic caliphate. Then launch a series of catastrophic attacks on the United States. How is it possible that President Obama seems more interested in playing golf than in standing with our friends in the midst of a war that threatens our security too? I have just returned from leading a solidarity trip to Israel. My colleagues and I witnessed the jihadist offensive firsthand. In the three days we were there, Hamas fired more than 300 rockets at Israeli cities, including Jerusalem. We heard the Code Red alerts go off. We experienced the adrenaline that comes with running to a bomb shelter. We met with IDF soldiers on the front lines near Gaza. We visited parents whose only son was kidnapped and murdered by these jihadists just weeks ago. I was deeply impressed by the courage and resilience of the Israeli people in the face of this cruel enemy. I was blessed by seeing their immense love and appreciation for America, and particularly for U.S. funding of their miraculous Iron Dome rocket defense system. But I was also struck by how many Israelis privately expressed to me their growing fear that Obama does not seem to truly understand what is happening in the region, and isn’t sufficiently determined to defeat this enemy. The president has told us repeatedly that “al-Qaida is on the run” and “we have decimated al-Qaida.” But his policies have actually allowed the jihadists to become stronger. In 2011, I warned that the president’s foolish and reckless Iraq policy — especially his inability to build an effective working relationship with the Iraqi leadership, and his decision to precipitously withdraw all U.S. military forces by the end of that year — meant the United States would lose the war in Iraq, and create an environment into which other radical Islamic forces would be drawn in. That now appears to be true. There is a way to turn this around. The president should immediately: Crush the Islamic State and prevent a caliphate. Hit them hard and relentlessly from the air. Pinpricks have slowed the Islamic State advance, but is the president willing to accept a country in the heart of the Middle East governed by such Islamic radicals? Decisive air power is needed now. Arm the Kurds. The Kurdish people in northern Iraq are fighting for their lives. They have long proven their friendship with America. They have demonstrated they are a moderate, peaceful Muslim people. They have tried to create a safe haven for Christians and other minorities. Stand with them. Provide them weapons of the amount and caliber that will truly help them defend their people. Help the new Iraqi prime minister. Nouri al-Maliki is gone. Good. Haider al-Abadi is new but untested. Work with him. Show him and the Iraqi people that America has not cut them loose. Urge them to build an inclusive democracy that truly and fully welcomes and empowers Sunnis as well as Shias, along with Christians, Kurds and all other minority groups. Provide Baghdad with real-time intelligence, as well as more military training and logistical support to regain the upper hand against the radicals. Stand with Israel. John Kerry has been a disaster as secretary of state. Bring in a special envoy who treats Israel as a true friend and faithful American ally, not an irritant or obstacle to Mideast peace. Stop pressuring the Israelis to accept premature and deeply flawed ceasefire agreements. Stop halting or micromanaging the transfer of weapons to Israel that we have already promised them. Stand with the Israelis without hesitation or prevarication. Support our Arab friends. The Egyptians, Jordanians, Saudis, and some in the Gulf know firsthand the threat posed by the radicals. They want to work with the United States to prevent the creation of a caliphate. They feel abandoned by this White House, which seems more focused on helping Hamas and placating Iran than engaging friends. Seal America’s southern border. Every day this administration refuses to stop people crossing from Mexico into the United States illegally, the more likely terrorists will use these routes to plant sleeper cells inside the homeland. Turn up the heat on Iran. The most serious threat to America, Israel, and our Arab allies is a nuclear-armed Iran. The Iranians are playing this White House. They want a deal that allows them to keep all of their centrifuges and enrichment equipment, their stockpiles of uranium, and their capacity to race for a nuclear bomb within a matter of months. Say no. Implement tougher sanctions. Move more military assets into the Gulf region. Make clear there will be serious consequences if Iran continues to defy the international community. American leadership in the Mideast matters for our national security. There is a window of time for America to regain the initiative, and protect ourselves and our allies, but we need a leader who levels with the American people about the nature of the threat and the serious consequences of inaction. Mr. President, it is time to tee it up in the game that you were elected to play.
