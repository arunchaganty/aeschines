"She was a ""Goldwater"" girl. She constantly changes her views depending on who she is trying to win votes from. She flip-flops on issues such as gay marriage, getting money out of politics, and said she will release Wall St. transcripts but has not done so as of yet. I have also read many stories and seen videos of her just flat out lying to American people. She takes donations from big oi/energy, Wall St. Banks, and other special interest groups. The Clinton Foundation is not as charitable as she makes it seem."
